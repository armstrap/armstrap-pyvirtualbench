# What is VirtualBench?
Five Instruments. One Device. Radically Practical.

By combining the most essential instruments into one device and integrating with PCs and iPads, the VirtualBench all-in-one instrument is simple, is convenient, and opens up new possibilities for how you can interact with benchtop instruments.

Whatâ€™s Included?
 1. Mixed-Signal Oscilloscope With Protocol Analysis
 2. Function Generator
 3. Digital I/O, SPI master, I2C master
 4. Programmable DC Power Supply
 5. Digital Multimeter

* [Python >= 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  You will need 32-bit Python support to work with the NI-provided drivers.
* `./examples/hands_free_dmm.py` Requirements
    + [Infinity USB Digital Foot Control with Computer plug (IN-USB2)](http://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Digital-Control-Computer--USB2/dp/B002MY6I7G)
    + pip install pywinusb
    + pip install Pyglet
    + copy `./support/avbin-win32-5.zip/avbin.dll` into your `c:\Windows\System32` directory

## Quickstart Guide
* Run the following on a Windows Command Line terminal
```
mkdir Projects
cd Projects
git clone https://github.com/armstrap/armstrap-pyvirtualbench.git
cd armstrap-pyvirtualbench
python -m pip install .
python examples\ps_example.py
```

## For Developers
* To install in "edit mode" - that is, to use the files directly in the project directory instead of making a read-only installation -
  in the above instructions replace
````
